Hi Shuai

You do not need to resubmit the risk assessment.

Comments on your report below.

You have managed to produce a lot of material, but the structure needs to be improved.

I would suggest deleting section 1.2.

You need to add a literature review section which discusses existing devices and their advantages and limitations.

You should include an overview of your devic, its structure and main components.

You should add a methodology section where you discuss device development and the reasons for the design choices you made.  It should also include details of the testing methodology you used.

The methodology section should be followed by a section which provides a detailed description of the different components of the device. Some of what you are calling the theory section should be moved to this section e.g. design of the user interface.   It should include some block diagrams showing the overall device structure.   You need to distinguish what is underlying theory e.g. how different technologies work and what is a description of the device.

The remaining theory section should be shorter and better structured with an overview of what the higher level theory subsections contain.  You have a section about RSSI support in the theory section, but you do not explain what RSSI support is.  You should also separate out the requirements of the smartphone from the theory section and explain why the phone needs these features.

What other team members have done is not part of future considerations.  Points you have not developed could go into future considerations.  You should relate what your device does to existiing systems. 

I disagree with you that white lettering on blue buttons on a grey background is necessarily a good colour contrast.  This is shown by figures 1 and 2.  I use black and white , so the contrast may be better in actual colour, but it seems poor to me and I find the lettering difficult to read.

The lettering in figure 16 and some of the other figures is small. Using italics makes it harder to read.
