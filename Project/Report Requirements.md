# 注意点
A report is not a story. Write ‘The voltage was measured’ rather than ‘I measured the voltage’. This document contains instructions and therefore uses a different style.

___
Analyse the uncertainties in your results to increase the impact of your results. 
Please avoid horrors like this: *The gain was quite accurate.* 

The sentence is meaningless and the reader will doubt whether you have any idea of the accuracy. 

Contrast this sentence: *The accuracy of the gain was estimated to be ±2%, limited by the tolerance of the resistors.* A detailed analysis is given in Appendix C. This is informative and convinces the reader that you have a full understanding.

那么我在写报告的时候就可以写蓝牙的信号测量并不准确,详情请参见下表

___

Avoid direct quotations from references in general; make it absolutely clear that the text is a quotation if this is unavoidable.


___
Reports whose references are all or mainly from the web, especially from anonymous sites, will be penalised.

参考文献完全或主要来自网络，尤其是匿名网站的报告，将受到处罚。

___
#页数限制
There are no strict limits to length of the report though as guide you should consider about 40-50 pages (approximately 10,000 to 15,000 words1) as being about right. Appendices are additional to this guideline. 

An electronic version of the report must be submitted as a PDF document on the Moodle page and checked using the plagiarism software.

书面报告 报告的长度没有严格的限制，但作为指南，你应该考虑大约40-50页（大约1万至1.5万字）为宜。附录不计入此指南。报告的电子版本必须以PDF文档形式提交到Moodle页面，并使用抄袭检测软件进行检查。

你的书面报告将由你的导师和审核员按照MSc项目报告评分指南进行评分。
