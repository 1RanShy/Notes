This section primarily explains why GPS navigation is not utilized in this project.

In open outdoor areas, GPS typically achieves a positioning accuracy of around 5 to 15 meters. However, this level of accuracy is insufficient for guiding visually impaired individuals to specific entrances within that distance. The strength of the positioning signal directly affects GPS accuracy. In areas with high-rise buildings or dense forests that create obstructions, GPS signals can be interfered with. GPS signals might disappear entirely when users are indoors, such as in basements. This underscores that GPS is unsuitable for indoor navigation and is not effective in aiding visually impaired users in finding entrances within the last 10 meters.

In this project, the HC-06 module is used as a Bluetooth beacon. The user's positioning is achieved by detecting the strength of the Bluetooth signal, which guides the user's direction and offers precise positioning of more than 1 meter. In terms of accuracy, it is completely feasible to use HC-06 as a beacon to navigate users.
