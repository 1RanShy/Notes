# Initial Pitch

A clear case for real-time processing 明确的实时处理案例。

Hi everyone, we are team number 35. This is our fifth teammate called nana.

And our idea is to design an automatic feeding machine, which can help people take care of their pets when they are not convenient. So you will not worry about them when you need to go outside for a long time.

Our machine should have the following functions:

Firstly, timed and quantified automatic feeding. Just like a human, eating meals at regular intervals and in fixed quantities is beneficial for the body. Some cats may be very greedy for food, but no, we can help her have a good figure.

Secondly, automatic disposal and recycling of leftover food in a period of time. Eating healthy food keeps our pets happy and energetic. Imagine, when our cat is sick, she can not call the doctor for help.

Thirdly, track the weight of food which pets intake. It is a good index by which we can analyse the appetite and mood of our pets. If they are not happy, maybe we should spare some time to accompany them. I think the cat is just like your girlfriend, she will never tell if she is happy or not. So one day u find that your cat just eats a little food, she is not sick, she is just a little unhappy. And she just wants your accompany.

Fourthly, the video monitoring function. If you miss your pet so much you can see your pets through our mobile application. 

The machine will also have other functions, such as a button if the pets press, and the feeder will play recording audio of the owner's voice.

In our project, two cases will need real-time processing.

Firstly, when recycling food, constantly monitor to ensure that no objects are blocking the lid of the recycling bin to prevent injury to pets. For example, if your cat is very naughty, she may put his claws into the rubbish bin.

Secondly, constantly check if the button is pressed, and if it is, play the sound of the owner's voice.
