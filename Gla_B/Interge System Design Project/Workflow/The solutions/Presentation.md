# Presentation

# 开头

Hi there. I am going to introduce the Carbon Emissions Accounting and Reporting.

# Presentation

## Steps

Carbon Emission Accounting should ber made up of five steps:

1. Determine the Scope of Calculation:
2. Collect Data:
3. Use Professional Calculation Tools
4. Compile Report
5. Post the report

And i will use swot analysis to analyse these steps

The strength is that the more accurate the accounting scope is determined, the smaller the accounting error. The data is the most convincing thing. And writing reports will make these data easily understandable for everyone, so they will know what they can do for decarbonising.

The weakness is that data is the most critical thing in this process. If there are lots of errors in the data. What we do in this process is useless. So the scope and professional tools are very important here. Also collecting the data will consume huge manpower.

The Opportunity is that Carbon accounting can provide jobs**. ​**As a university, we can set up a major which teaches other people to use professional tools to do carbon accounting. Also writing carbon accounting reports enhance the image of the campus.

The threats may be that we can not find someone who can use professionals to calculate carbon emissions in a short time. If the report cannot be released in time, it will lose its timeliness
