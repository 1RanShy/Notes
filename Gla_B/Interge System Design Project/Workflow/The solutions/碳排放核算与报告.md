# 碳排放核算与报告

Carbon accounting and reporting

碳排放核算和报告的具体方法可以包括以下步骤：

确定核算范围：核算校园内的所有源，包括能源消耗、交通、固体垃圾处理等。

Determine the Scope of Calculation: Account for all sources within the campus, including energy consumption, transportation, solid waste management, etc.

Advantages (Strengths): Determining the carbon emissions accounting scope can more accurately assess the carbon emissions situation and reduce accounting errors.

Disadvantages (Weaknesses): If the carbon emissions accounting scope is too narrow, it may ignore some important sources of emissions.

Opportunities (Opportunities): Determining the carbon emissions accounting scope can help the campus develop more effective carbon reduction plans and improve energy efficiency.

Threats (Threats): If the carbon emissions accounting scope is not sufficient to comprehensively assess the carbon emissions situation, the campus may face greater carbon emissions pressures.

收集数据：收集所需的数据，包括能源消耗、交通使用等。

Collect Data: Gather the necessary data, including energy consumption and transportation use.

Strength:  Collecting data can help us know the amount of carbon we have already emitted. It can also provide some jobs.

Weakness: This is very heavy work and will consume a lot of manpower and material resources.

Opportunities: Some people who do not have a job can be trained to do this job.

Threats: Some people may prevent us from collecting the data because this will hurt their benefits.

‍

利用核算工具：使用专业的碳排放核算工具，如 GHG Protocol，对数据进行计算。

Use Calculation Tools: Utilize professional GHG emission calculation tools such as GHG Protocol to calculate the data.

Strengths: Only with professional tools, we can get accurate data.

Weakness: Not everyone knows how to use this tool, so it will be a little hard to find someone to do this job. Or we need to train some people about how to use this tool.

Opportunities: We are a university, and we can set up a major in how to use carbon accounting professional tools.

Threats: Maybe there are just a few people who want to do this job, so we hardly find some people working for us. Or do we need to pay a high salary to them? Also setting up such a major is not an easy project.

‍

编写报告：将核算结果编写成报告，包括碳排放数量、排放源、减排措施等。

Compile Report: Compile the calculation results into a report, including the quantity of GHG emissions, sources of emissions, and mitigation measures.

Strengths: The report will show the carbon emission in a more understandable way. So that even those people who do not know what is carbon accounting can understand what these data mean. This report will make it easier for management to make decisions.

Weakness: This is work which will consume lots of manpower and time. We need to make sure the report is detailed and reliable. If the data is inaccurate or the accounting method is not reasonable, the reliability of carbon emission reporting may be affected.

Opportunities:

Writing a carbon report can demonstrate that the campus is environmentally responsible and enhance the image of the campus.

Threats:

Also, the report should be shown in time, otherwise, the report is useless and even has some negative effects.

Post the report on an application or a website so that people can read it in time.

Strength: People can know the details about carbon emissions, so they will know that what they do can really help in decarbonising.

Weakness: The help to decarbonization plans reflected in the data may be small, which will lead to a loss of confidence in the decarbonization plan.

Opportunities: Now that social media is very convenient in our daily life, it will be easy for people to look the report on mobile devices.

Threats: Heavy work for developing and maintaining an application which is dedicated to decarbonising.

‍

公开报告：公开报告结果，以便校园社区了解校园的碳排放情况和减排进展。

‍

设定减排目标：根据核算结果，确定减排目标，并制定减排计划。

通过这些步骤，可以了解校园的碳排放情况，并通过设定减排目标来确保校园可持续发展。
