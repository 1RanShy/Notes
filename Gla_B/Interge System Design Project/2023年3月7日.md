如何整理查到的材料:
我们论文的引用格式使用APA 7th格式 这个格式和APA兼容
大家在找资料时一定要保存好出处.
17号我们开始写自己的部分,或者大家可以现在就开始写自己的部分
If you want you can write your parts now.
So make sure you know where the documents come from.
[APA references Example](https://www.simpletense.com/blog/citation-styles/)
To unify the format:
References format, we use APA 7th like this:

It will be very easy for us to use APA 7th references if will use some tools such as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">endnote </mark>to help us do that.
The install package of Endnote and how to use it will be shown in the short vedio.
