Hi bro:

In the meeting, we come up with many solutions for project 2. And according to these solutions, we summarise 4 basic directions/criteria.

They are respectively:

1. Improving Energy Efficiency: Improving energy utilization efficiency through the transformation and upgrading of buildings, lighting, air conditioning, electrical appliances and other equipment. Transformation of the power supply network. By Wang Mengyuan and Chen Siyu.

2. Promoting Renewable Energy: Establishing solar, wind, geothermal and other renewable energy power generation systems in the campus to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. By Wang Renfei and Liang Yu.

3. Carbon Emission Accounting and Reporting: Conducting carbon emission accounting and making public reports to understand the carbon emission situation in campus and clarify emission reduction goals. By Ran Shuai.

4. Green Building: Building green buildings that meet green building standards through design, construction and other means, reducing the impact of buildings on the environment. Measuring temperature difference. By Muhammad Monis.

You can see that behind each direction, there is one teammate's name. It means that you should find more specific solutions in this direction. And use swot to analyse these solutions. It is better to have some references and data to support your ideas. Your task should be the fourth direction.

And the mentor changed the online meeting time. It will be at 2:30 pm Tommow [Tuesday]. If you have time, you can join this meeting.
