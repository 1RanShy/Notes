这个是老师的要求,我们找材料的时候应该找这7方面的材料:
This is the teacher's requirement. When we look for materials, we should search for materials from these 7 aspects:

efficiency
cost
impact
sustainability ......

# Plan to 17 March
还是先找材料,但是我们每周就是开会看看大家找的材料确保最后大家找的材料是可以使用的,没有做无用功.

We should still start by looking for materials, but every week we will have a meeting to review the materials that everyone has found to ensure that the materials are useful and that no effort has been wasted.

# School Library
这是图书馆官网的网址我们可以在上面查找我们需要的材料.当然其他网站的资料也可以.
This is the website address of the library's official website where we can search for the materials we need. Of course, we can also use materials from other websites.
