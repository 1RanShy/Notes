# Conclusion
格拉斯哥大学是一个需要大量能源消耗的研究型大学,为了节能减排我们为格拉斯哥大学提出如下几条建议:
1. 进行碳排放计算并及时发布碳排放报告.这一举措会让人们及时了解到格拉斯哥大学在节能减排方面所作出的努力.并且从碳排放报告中,我们能了解到如何采取更有效的措施来节能减排.
2. 提高能源的利用效率.经过线路改造,学校里的所有用电器都可以通过手机app来控制开关,并且能够在手机上实时查看学校所有用电器的用电量.我们可以通过这个app远程关闭无用的的用电器.也可以设置定时开关来批量打开和关闭用电器,以此来节约一些不必要的电量消耗.
3. 电网改造.这主要是增加导线的横截面积以此来减少电能在运输中的损耗.但此项改造设计到建筑的破坏,电路的重新设计等.耗费巨大的人力物力,因此我们会将这个选项放在最后.
4. 绿色建筑.通过对建筑材料和结构的合理改造能够达到采光充足,冬暖夏凉等.这也许能节约能源,但是与高额的改造费用来说也许是得不偿失的.同时我们小组的成员认为对于格拉斯哥具有悠久历史的古建筑进行改造是一种破坏文物的行为.因此绿色建筑这个选项并不被我们采纳.
因此我们最终决定通过计算碳排放,改造格拉斯哥电网,通过手机app来提高电能利用效率来帮助格拉斯哥大学节能减排,实现脱碳.

The University of Glasgow is a research-intensive university that requires a significant amount of energy consumption. In order to reduce energy consumption and emissions, we propose the following suggestions for the University of Glasgow:

1.  Conduct carbon emission calculations and release emission reports in a timely manner. This measure will inform people of the efforts made by the University of Glasgow in energy conservation and emission reduction. Through the emission reports, we can also learn how to take more effective measures to save energy and reduce emissions.
    
2.  Improve energy utilization efficiency. After the line transformation, all electrical appliances in the school can be controlled by a mobile app, and the power consumption of all electrical appliances in the school can be viewed in real-time on the mobile phone. We can remotely turn off unused electrical appliances through this app, and also set scheduled switches to turn on and off electrical appliances in batches to save unnecessary energy consumption.
    
3.  Electrical grid transformation. This mainly involves increasing the cross-sectional area of the wires to reduce energy loss during transportation. However, this transformation involves building destruction, circuit redesign, and requires significant human and material resources. Therefore, we will prioritize this option last.
    
4.  Green building. Reasonable transformations of building materials and structures can achieve sufficient daylight and comfortable temperatures. This may save energy, but it may not be cost-effective compared to the high cost of transformation. At the same time, our team members believe that transforming the historic buildings in Glasgow is a destructive act towards cultural heritage. Therefore, we do not adopt this option.
    

Therefore, we ultimately decide to help the University of Glasgow reduce energy consumption and emissions, and achieve decarbonization through carbon emission calculations, electrical grid transformation, and improving energy utilization efficiency through a mobile app.
